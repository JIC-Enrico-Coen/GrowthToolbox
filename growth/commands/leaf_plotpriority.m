function [m,ok] = leaf_plotpriority( m, values, priority, threshold, varargin )
%m = leaf_plotpriority( m, factors, priority, thresholds, ... )
%   Set the plotting priorities of specified factors or cell factors --
%   hereafter called factors.  In multi-plot mode, the priorities determine
%   whether factors present at the same place are mixed, or one overlies
%   the other.
%   The default priority for all factors is 0.  When multiple factors
%   of differing priorities are plotted together, the procedure for
%   determining the colour of a vertex is as follows:
%   1.  For each group of factors of the same priority, the colors for
%       those factors are mixed.  This gives one coloring of the whole
%       mesh for each priority group.
%   2.  At each vertex of the mesh, the chosen colour is taken from the
%       color map of highest priority for which at least one of the
%       associated factors is above its plotting threshold at that
%       vertex.
%   If the canvas has a background colour, it is considered to have
%   the same priority as the factor with least priority, or zero,
%   whichever is less.
%
%   Arguments:
%   1: The name or index of a factor, or a cell array of names or an
%      array of indexes.
%   2: The priorities of the listed factors.  If a single value is given
%      it is applied to all of them. If multiple values are given there
%      must be exactly as many of them as in the list of factors.
%      Priorities can be any numerical value.
%   3: Thresholds for each of the listed factors.  If a single
%      value is given it is applied to all of them. If multiple values are
%      given there must be exactly as many of them as in the list of
%      factors. A factor whose value is less than or equal
%      to its threshold will be treated as zero for the purpose of masking
%      lower-priority factors.  Use zero if no threshold is to be applied.
%
%   Example:
%       m = leaf_mgen_plotpriority( m, ...
%              {'id_sink','id_source','id_ridge'}, [1 1 2], [0,0,0.1], ...
%              'type', 'morphogen' );
%   This gives priority 2 to the morphogen id_ridge, 1 to id_sink and
%   id_source, and leaves all others with the default priority of zero.  If
%   all morphogens are being plotted together, then where id_ridge is
%   greater than 0.1, its colour will be plotted.  Elsewhere, where id_sink or
%   id_source is greater than zero, their colours will be mixed and plotted.
%   Everywhere else, the other morphogen colours will be mixed together.
%   This will have the effect that id_ridge will overlie id_sink and
%   id_source, and all three will overlie all other morphogens.
%
%   Equivalent GUI operation: None.
