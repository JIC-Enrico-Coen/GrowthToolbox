function nearest = find_closest ( dim_num, n, sample_num, s, r, w )

%% FIND_CLOSEST finds the nearest R point to each S point.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This routine finds the closest Voronoi cell generator by checking every
%    one.  For problems with many cells, this process can take the bulk
%    of the CPU time.  Other approaches, which group the cell generators into
%    bins, can run faster by a large factor.
