Add a folder to the Projects menu.  This may be either a single project or
a folder containing many projects. The added folder will remain on the Projects menu
across invocations of GFtbox.

On startup, and when you use the Projects>Refresh command, all user projects
directories will be searched for projects and they will be added as submenus.

The GUI does not provide a way to remove folders from the Projects menu. To do
that, you need to close GFtbox and manually edit GFtbox_config.txt in the
GrowthToolbox directory and delete all unwanted lines that begin "projectdir".
When you restart GFtbox the deleted items will no longer appear on the Projects menu.

Delete all stage times from the Stages menu for which there is no saved file.

#deleteAllStagesItem (menu item)
Delete all stage files from disc. The corresponding stage times remain
in the Stages menu.

#deleteStagesAndTimesItem (menu item)
Delete all stage files from disc and all stage times from the Stages menu.

#movieMenu Movie (menu item)
This menu performs various operations relating to the recording of
movies of the mesh.

#movieAllStagesItem (menu item)
Make a movie from all of the currently existing stage files, without
performing any simulation calculations.  The current plotting options will
be used for all frames of the movie.

#movieStagesItem (menu item)
Make a movie from a specified time range of the currently existing stage files, without
performing any simulation calculations.  The current plotting options will
be used for all frames of the movie.

#plotMenu Plot (menu item)
This menu sets various parameters to vary the appearance of the picture.

#paramsMenu Params (menu item)
*

#meshMenu Mesh (menu item)
*

#projectsMenu Projects (menu item)
*

#dateItem (menu item)

#enabledisableIFitem Enable Interaction Function (menu item)
Enable or disable the calling of the interaction function at the start
of every simulation step. There is rarely any reason to disable it.

#validateMeshItem Validate Mesh (menu item)
Perform a check on the internal consistency of the mesh data structure.

#useGraphicsCardItem Snapshot screen res (menu item)
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked, GFtbox will attempt to speed up computations by
performing them on the graphics card, if possible.  It will first check
to see if the graphics card can handle the computation and the relevant
Matlab library is present, giving a warning if either condition fails.

When it is unchecked, it will not use the graphics card for its
computations.

#hiresOptionsItem
This opens a dialog for setting options for high-resolution snapshots and movies.
It contains three boolean flags to specify whether hi-res images will be saved for,
respectively, user-requested snapshots, automatic stage file snapshots, and movies.
The width, height, and magnification factor can be specified.  There are dependencies
among these: changing any one changes the other two.  You should not change hires
options that affect movies while a movie is in progress.

#alwaysRectifyVerticalsItem Always Rectify Verticals (menu item)
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked, after each growth step, each pair of vertices on opposite
sides of the mesh will be adjusted so that the line between them remains
perpendicular to the surface of the mesh.  This is a remeshing of the substance,
not an elastic deformation of the substance.

When unchecked, no such constraint is applied.

#useprevdispItem Use Prev Displacement as Guess (menu item)
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked, the displacements computed in the previous simulation
step will be used as the initial guess in the iterative process for
computing the displacements in the current simulation step. On the first
simulation step, the estimate will be a very small random amount.

When it is unchecked, the initial guess is a very small random amount.

There is generally no reason to turn this off.

#stripsaveItem Strip Saved Meshes (menu item)
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked, meshes saved to MAT files (including all stage files
and the initial state) have some unnecessary information deleted from them
to save space. The information is reconstructed when the files are loaded.

When unchecked, the entire data stucture is saved.

#GUIformat GUI format... (menu item)
Adjust parameters of the GUI appearance, such as font size.

#thumbnailItem Make Thumbnail (menu item)
Save a small picture of the current state of the mesh to serve as a
thumbnail picture for the project.

#compressionQualityItem Quality...
Set the compression quality of subsequently recorded movies. The range is
from 100 (no compression) downwards. The lower the number, the smaller the
movie file, but the lower the visual quality of the movie.  The effect will
depend on which movie codec is being used.

#RecordMeshes Also record meshes (menu item)
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked, and a movie is being recorded, for each frame added to the movie
the entire mesh structure will also be saved as a MAT file. (This can take up a lot
of disc space.)

#gyrateItem Gyrate... (menu item)
Replot the mesh several times in succession while tilting it up and down
and rotating it around the Z axis, ending in the same orientation as it began.
If a movie is being recorded, all of these views will be added to it.

A dialog will be opened in which you can select the number of movie frames
over which the movement should be performed.

#tiltItem Tilt... (menu item)
Replot the mesh several times in succession while tilting it up and down,
ending in the same orientation as it began. If a movie is being recorded,
all of these views will be added to it.

A dialog will be opened in which you can select the number of movie frames
over which the movement should be performed.

#spinItem Spin... (menu item)
Replot the mesh several times in succession while rotating it around the
Z axis, ending in the same orientation as it began. If a movie is being
recorded, all of these views will be added to it.

A dialog will be opened in which you can select the number of movie frames
over which the movement should be performed.

#codecMenu Codec (menu item)
Choose a compressed movie format for all subsequently recorded movies.
Any movie currently being recorded is not affected.

Warning: Not all compressors work on all platforms, but the only way to
determine if a compressor is supported is to try it and see.

Motion JPEG AVI is probably the best choice (considering both the
size of the movie and compatibility with other movie playback software),
followed by MPEG-4, which produces much smaller files but much poorer image quality.

#frameRateItem Frame rate... (menu item)
Set the playback frame rate of all subsequently created movies. Any movie
currently being recorded is not affected.

This frame rate is not related to the simulation time step.

#addFrameItem Add frame (menu item)
Add the current view of the mesh as a single frame to the movie currently
being recorded.

#replotItem Replot (menu item)
Force the mesh to be redrawn. It should never be necessary to use this.

#setLegendItem Set Legend... (menu item)
Specify a string to append to the end of the information included in the
legend (the large text at the top of the picture). Dynamic information can be specified:

%t time (number only)

%T time (with unit name, or if none, preceded by "time")

%q name of the quantity being plotted; "MULTIPLE" if more than one.

%m If no mutants are in use, nothing. Otherwise either "WILDTYPE" if no mutations active, or "MUTANT" followed by a list of the mutations.

\n newline character

\t tab character

\\ backslash character


#canvasColorsItem Set Canvas Colors... (menu item)
Specify the colour of the canvas and the colour of the finite element
edges. The canvas colour is only effective in multiplotting mode.

#lightMenuItem Turn Light On/Off (menu item)
Turn a light on or off within the scene. Turning the light on can improve the visual
appearance. The position and intensity of the light are not adjustable.

#ambientItem Ambient Light... (menu item)
Set the level of ambient lighting. This only has effect if the light is
turned on. (See Plot>Turn Light On/Off.)

#opacityItem Opacity... (menu item)
Set the opacity of the mesh. 0 is invisibly transparent; 1 is totally opaque.

Because Matlab may use different graphics procedures,
depending on whether opacity is exactly 1 or less than 1, you may sometimes
find that an opaque plot looks better if the opacity is set to a hair under
1, e.g. 0.999.

#lineSmoothingItem Line Smoothing (menu item)
Set whether Matlab should anti-alias lines, enhancing the quality of the
image. Default value is true.

Depending on the choice of Renderer, this may not have any effect. When it is
effective, it may produce odd results unless Opacity is also set to exactly 1.

#cellsonbothsidesItem Duplicate cells on both sides (menu item)
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked, every biological cell is drawn on both sides of the mesh.

When it is unchecked, each cell is drawn on only the side it belongs to.
Connected cells always belong to the same side of the mesh, but separate
clumps are assigned to random sides on creation.

#staticDecorItem Static Decorations
This is a toggleable menu item.

When it is checked (the default), polariser gradient arrows will tend to be
in the same positions from one iteration to the next.

When it is unchecked, and the Sparsity value is positive, the positions of the
polariser gradient arrows will be completely different from one iteration to the next.

#normalsMenuItem Show Normals (menu item)
This alternates between Show Normals and Hide Normals.

Show Normals causes each finite element's normal vector to be drawn,
originating at its centre, on the side selected by the Decor A/B radio
buttons in the Plot Options panel.  If a positive value is selected for
Sparsity, arrows will be drawn only for selected cells at spaced-out
intervals.

#displacementsMenuItem Show Displacements (menu item)
This alternates between Show Displacements and Hide Displacements.

Show Displacements causes a displacement arrow to be drawn from each vertex
of the mesh after each simulation step, showing its movement in the last
simulation step. Only the relative lengths of the arrows are meaningful:
they are scaled so that the largest has a convenient length.

#axesMenuItem Show/Hide Axes (menu item)
This alternates between Show Axes and Hide Axes.

Show Axes causes a set of X-Y-Z axes to be drawn.

#axesMenuItem Show/Hide Colorbar (menu item)
This alternates between Show Colorbar and Hide Colorbar.

Show Colorbar causes the colorbar at the right edge of the picture
to be drawn, when there is a nonempty range of colours to display.

#seamsMenuItem Show/Hide Seams (menu item)
Show Seams draws the seam edges as thick red lines.

Hide Seams draws them the same as any other edge.

#makevvbutton Create
Generate a VV layer.

#showmeshMenuItem Show/Hide Mesh (menu item)
Specifies whether the finite element mesh should be drawn.

#vvMenuItem Show VV Layer (menu item)
This alternates between Show VV Layer and Hide VV Layer, specifying whether
the VV layer (if present) should be drawn.

#thicknessMenuItem Show/Hide Thickness (menu item)
Show Thickness draws the mesh as a surface of finite thickness.

Hide Thickness draws it as a zero-thickness sheet.

#scalebarscaleItem Scale Bar Scaling... (menu item)
Have the scale bar scaled up from its proper size. The number you type into
the dialog is the 

#scalebarMenuItem Show/Hide Scale Bar (menu item)
Show Scale Bar draws a scale bar in the bottom left corner of the plot.

#legendMenuItem Show/Hide Legend (menu item)
Determine whether the legend should be drawn. This is a piece large text at
the top of the figure which mhows the current time,
the name of the currently plotted morphogen, and the set of mutant
moprhogens (if any).

#whiteMenuItem White bgnd (menu item)
Make the background of the picture white. Best for printed materials.
The legend, scale bar, axes and finite element edges will be black.

#blackMenuItem Black bgnd (menu item)
Make the background of the picture black. Best for presentations.
The legend, scale bar, axes and finite element edges will be white.

#multiplotItem Multi-plot (menu item)
Bring up a dialog to choose a set or morphogens to plot simultaneously.

The multi-plotting will not actually be done unless the Multi-plot checkbox
in the Plot Options panel is turned on.

#makefigItem Make External Figure (menu item)
Plot the mesh in a separate figure window.

#stereoItem Stereo... (menu item)
(Not yet supported.)

#nodeNumbersItem Show Node Numbers... (menu item)
Display the index number of every vertex of the mesh.

#edgeNumbersItem Show Edge Numbers... (menu item)
Display the index number of every edge of the mesh.

#FENumbersItem Show FE Numbers... (menu item)
Display the index number of every finite element of the mesh.

#rendererMenu Renderer (menu item)
This submenu lists all of Matlab's available renderers (the graphics
libraries it uses to draw to the screen).  OpenGL is usually the
best one to use, but in certain versions of Matlab, combined with certain
versions of Windows and certain versions of the video hardware drivers,
defects of rendering show up.  If this happens try using one of the other
renderers.

#openGLRendererItem OpenGL
Use the "OpenGL" graphics library for drawing things on the screen.

#zbuggerRendererItem zbuffers
Use the "zbuffers" graphics library for drawing things on the screen.

#paintersRendererItem painters
Use the "painters" graphics library for drawing things on the screen.

#noneRendererItem None
Do not use any graphics library for drawing things on the screen.  The effect
of selecting this is that the mesh will not be drawn.  This option is only
included because it is possible, not because it serves any practical purpose.

#allowbiooverlapCheckbox Allow overlap
When scattering biological cells at random, allow them to overlap each other.
If this is turned off, no cell will be created overlapping an existing one.
As a result, the number of cells created will in general be less than the
number requested.

#relativepolgrad
When turned on, the Min.pol.grad. value is understood as relative to
the polariser magnitude.  When turned off, the Min.pol.grad. value
is an absolute one.

#axisRangeFromPictureButton
Set the axis range that will be used
when autoscaling is off, from
the current axis range.

#precisionItem (menu item)
Select single or double precision for the elasticity computation.

#singlePrecisionItem (menu item)
Select single precision for the elasticity computation.

#doublePrecisionItem (menu item)
Select double precision for the elasticity computation.

#solverItem (menu item)
Select the solver for the elasticity computation.

#cgsSolverItem (menu item)
Use the CGS (conjugate gradient squared) solver for the elasticity computation.

#lsqrSolverItem (menu item)
Use the LSQR (least squares) solver for the elasticity computation.

#culaSgesvSolverItem (menu item)
Use the culaSgesv solver for the elasticity computation.
This requires an installation of the CULA library (at Basic level or higher)
from culatools.org, and also compilation of test_culaSgels.cpp with mex.

#errorTypeMenu Error Measurement (menu item)
Select whether the error in the computation of elasticity or diffusion
should be measured as the maximum error at any vertex or the root mean square
error.  The former is generally preferable.

#normErrorItem Norm (menu item)
Measure the error in the computation of elasticity or diffusion as the
root mean square error at any vertex.  This is the less preferred option.

#maxabsErrorItem Norm (menu item)
Measure the error in the computation of elasticity or diffusion as the
maximum error at any vertex.  This is the preferred option.

#catchIFExceptionsItem
This determines how GFtbox handles errors in the interaction function.

When turned on, (the default), the error is detected, the simulation is
stopped, the interaction function is disabled, and the elements in the
GUI relating to the i.f. turn red.

When off, Matlab will stop execution of the interaction function immediately.
If "Breakpoints > Stop on Errors" is turned on in the Matlab editor,
Matlab will then enter the debugger at the place where the error occurred.

The setting is global, not specific to the current project.  It
persists across invocations of Matlab and is stored (if changed from the
default) in the user's config file in the setting "catchIFExceptions".

End users should mostly leave this turned on.  Those who want to use the
debugger to determine what went wrong should turn this off.  

#timeCommandsItem
When checked, the time taken for each GUI command executed is shown in
the Matlab console.  Not all GUI commands are timed.

#vvsegsperedgetext (uicontrol, vvsegsperedgetext, 3) has no tooltip string.
Set the number of subsegments ethat ach cell wall segment should be divided into.
