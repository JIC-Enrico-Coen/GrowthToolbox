%   Given an array VALUES, an array INDEXES of the same shape as VALUES
%   consisting of indexes into another array of shape SHAPE, and an array
%   of weights of shape SHAPE, construct an array A of the shape such that
%   A(I) = the weighted average of the elements of VALUES for which the
%   corresponding element of INDEXES is I.  N is a list of the total weight
%   each index occurred with.
%
%   SHAPE defaults to a column vector whose length is the largest member of
%   INDEXES.
