function [numevents,times] = poissevents( rate, duration )
%[numevents,times] = poissevents( rate, duration )
%   This is equivalent to (and calls) numevents = poissrnd(rate*duration),
%   but in addition returns the times at which the events happen.
%   Conditional on the number of events, these are uniformly distributed in
%   the range from 0 to duration. The times are returned in increasing
%   order.
%
%   Duration defaults to 1.
