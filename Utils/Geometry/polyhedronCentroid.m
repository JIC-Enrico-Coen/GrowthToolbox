function c = polyhedronCentroid( pts, sides )
%c = polyhedronCentroid( pts, sides )
%   PTS is N*D, representing a set of points in D-dimensional space, and
%   SIDES is a T*D array of indexes into PTS, representing a set of
%   simplexes defining a polyhedron.
%
%   This procedure finds the centroid of the polyhedron, as a row vector.
%   The polyhedron must be closed.  The orientation of its faces must be
%   consistent, but it does not matter whether it is left- or right-handed.
%
%   This works in any number of dimensions from 2 upwards.
%
%   This will not work for polygons in 3-dimensional space, for which see
%   polyCentroid.
%
%   For polygons in the plane, SIDES can be omitted, in which case the
%   points are assumed to be listed in order around the polygon.

    % As a check, translating, scaling, or rotating the points should
    % produce the same transformation of the centroid.
