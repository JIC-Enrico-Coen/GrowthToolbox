%[principalAxes,eigs] = bestFitEllipsoid( vxs, wts )
%   Find the best-fit ellipsoid containing the vertexes VXS, an N*D array
%   where D is the number of dimensions.  The result is returned as a
%   matrix of column vectors, being the principal axes of the ellipsoid,
%   and a column vector of the eigenvalues.  The eigenvalues are listed
%   in arbitrary order, and are proportional to the squares of the lengths
%   of the ellipsoid's principal axes.
%
%   WTS is an optional parameter specifying a weight for each vertex.  If
%   WTS is absent or empty the weights are taken to be equal.  If WTS is
%   the string 'area' then the members of vxs are assumed to be the
%   vertexes of a polygon, listed in order along its boundary, and the
%   weights will be a measure of the amount of the polygon's circumference
%   associated with each vertex. This makes the results largely independent
%   of how densely the vertexes are distributed around the perimeter of the
%   polygon.
%
%   If ORIGIN is specified, it is a single point, and the ellipse is the
%   best-fitting one conditional on having its centre at that point.
