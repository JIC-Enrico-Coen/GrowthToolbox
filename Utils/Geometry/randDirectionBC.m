%dbc = randDirectionBC( vxs, n )
%   Select N uniformly distributed directions parallel to the triangle whose
%   three vertexes are the rows of vxs, and express them as directional
%   barycentric coordinates with respect to those points.
%
%   Directional barycentric coordinates always sum to 0. Their meaning is
%   invariant under scaling, and we do not attempt to normalise any
%   measure of their scale. The directions of the vectors dbs*vxs will be
%   uniformly distributed in the plane of the triangle.
%
%   If the triangle has zero area, then the components of dbc will all be NaN.
