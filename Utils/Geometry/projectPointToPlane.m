%   Project P in direction DIR onto the plane defined by the three vertexes
%   VXS, giving point PP.  VXS is a 3*D matrix of three row vectors of any
%   dimensionality D.  If the three points are collinear, then P is projected
%   onto the line they define.  N can be of any non-zero length.  It
%   defaults to a vector normal to the plane.
%   BC is set to the barycentric coordinates of the projected point with
%   respect to VXS, as a 1*D row vector.  The equality PP == BCS*VXS
%   holds.  When the three points are collinear, the third component of BC
%   is always zero.  P may be an K*D matrix of row vectors for any K.
