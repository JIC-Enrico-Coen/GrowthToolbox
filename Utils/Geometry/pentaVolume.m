function vol = pentaVolume( vxs )
%vol = pentaVolume( vxs )
%   Calculate the volue of a pentahedral element defined by six vertexes
%   given by the 6*3 array VXS. The vertexes of one triangular face are
%   VXS([1 3 5],:), and those of the other are VXS([2 4 6],:). The vectors
%   from the first triangle to the second are assumed to be small.
