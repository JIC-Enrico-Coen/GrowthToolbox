function [c,p,flatness,planarity,v,d] = bestFitPlane( vxs, weights )
%[c,p,flatness,planarity,v,d] = bestFitPlane( vxs, weights )
%   Find the best-fit plane through the vertexes VXS, an N*D array where D
%   is the number of dimensions.  The result is returned in the form of C,
%   the centroid of the vertexes, and P, the unit normal vector to the plane
%   through C, both as row vectors.  FLATNESS is a measure of how flat the
%   set of points is, and is the ratio of the smallest to second smallest
%   eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.  Zero means very flat, 1 means not
%   at all flat. PLANARITY is a different measure of flatness, the ratio of
%   the smallest eigenvalue to the sum of eigenvalues. It varies betwen 0
%   (absolutely flat) and 1/3 (not at all flat). V is a 3x3 matrix whose
%   columns are the axes of the best-fit ellipsoid. D is the eigenvalues in
%   ascending order. V lists the eigenvectors in the same order. When the
%   vertexes lie approximately in a plane, the smallest eigenvalue will be
%   close to zero, abd the corresponding eigenvector will be the
%   perpendicular to that plane. The ratio of the other two will express
%   how elongated a shape it makes in that plane. This ratio will be
%   between 0 (a straight line) and 1 (circular).
%
%   WEIGHTS, if supplied, weights the vertices.  When the weights are
%   integers, this is exactly equivalent to repeating each vertex as many
%   times as its weight. By default all weights are 1.
%
%   If WEIGHTS is 'length', then the best fit plane will be calculated for
%   the circumference of the polygon whose vertexes are vxs, listed in order
%   round the polygon, as if points were sampled at equal distances
%   around the circumference.
%
%   If WEIGHTS is 'area', then the best fit plane will be calculated for
%   the area of the polygon whose vertexes are vxs, listed in order
%   round the polygon, as if points were sampled at equal density over
%   its area. When the polygon is not flat, it is assumed
%   to consist of triangles between each consecutive pair of vertexes and
%   the centroid.
%
%   'area' and 'length' are in fact mathematically equivalent, and the same
%   calculation is made for both.
