%   Select a random number of points from each of the bins, in proportion
%   to their size.  The result is a list, in random order, of which bin
%   each point falls in.
%
%   If uniformise is true (the default is false) then each bin is
%   guaranteed to have n members, where n is one of the two integers on
%   either side of its expected number of members.
%
%   If the binsizes are all zero, they are taken to be all 1.
%
%   Only the relative sizes of the bins matter.

%   There might be a more efficient way to do this, taking time proportional
%   to the number of bins and independent of the number of points.
