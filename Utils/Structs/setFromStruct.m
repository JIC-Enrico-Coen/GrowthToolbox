%   all fields of T.  Other fields of s are left unchanged.
%   If the input argument s is empty, it is replaced by the empty struct.
%   If mode is 'all' (the default) then all specified fields are used.  If
%   mode is 'existing', then only fields that already exist in s (and in t)
%   will be updated. Fields that exist in s but not in t will not be
%   deleted from s.  If t is empty, no change is made to s (except that if
%   s is also empty, it is returned as a struct with no fields).
%
%   If fns contains a single field, it can be supplied as a string instead
%   of a cell array containing that string.
